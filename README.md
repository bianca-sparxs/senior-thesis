closley following [http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/]
### Premise
Escape the dungeon! (...& look for the key, if you want)
Press 'S' to go back/forth in Seek Mode (looking for the Key)

Other people are in the dungeon too and you may have to interact with them

### Mechanics
- Energy: you need energy to do go through, without it you go to sleep(?)
    - energy slowly drops throughout game
    - food restores energy
    - certain interactions with people can give you back energy
- Motivation: lower motivation, higher energy cost
